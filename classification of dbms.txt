Database Management Systems (DBMS) can be broadly classified into two main categories:
 Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management Systems (Non-RDBMS or NoSQL databases).

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS):

Tabular Structure: Data is organized into tables with rows and columns.

Structured Query Language (SQL): Utilizes SQL for defining, querying, and manipulating data.

ACID Properties: Emphasizes ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure data integrity and transactional reliability.

Schema: Requires a predefined schema that defines the structure of the data, including tables, fields, and relationships.

Normalization: Often employs normalization techniques to reduce redundancy and dependency in data.

Examples:
MYSQL,PostgreSQL,Oracle Database,Microsoft SQL Server



Non-Relational Database Management Systems (NoSQL or Non-RDBMS):

Diverse Data Models: Supports various data models, including document-oriented, key-value pairs, column- family, and graph databases.

Schema Flexibility: Allows for schema-less or dynamic schema structures, providing flexibility to handle evolving data requirements.

CAP Theorem: May prioritize aspects of the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) differently based on the specific type of NoSQL database. 

Horizontal Scalability: Generally designed to scale horizontally, distributing data across multiple servers or nodes.

Performance Optimization: Emphasizes performance and scalability over strict consistency in certain scenarios.

Examples:
MongoDB (Document-oriented)
Cassandra (Column-family)
